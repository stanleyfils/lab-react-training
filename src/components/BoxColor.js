// Iteration 4: Component: BoxColor
// Create a BoxColor component that displays a rectangle with a background color based on props. For this, you will need a inline style (documentation).

// It takes 3 props:

// r: A number between 0 and 255 representing the amount of red
// g: A number between 0 and 255 representing the amount of green
// b: A number between 0 and 255 representing the amount of blue
